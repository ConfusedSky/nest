  = note: the following trait bounds were not satisfied:
          `f32: SetValue<'_, wren::context::Foreign>`
          which is required by `f32: ForeignCallOutput`
          `&f32: SetValue<'_, wren::context::Foreign>`
          which is required by `&f32: ForeignCallOutput`
          `&mut f32: SetValue<'_, wren::context::Foreign>`
          which is required by `&mut f32: ForeignCallOutput`
  = note: this error originates in the attribute macro `foreign_static_method` (in Nightly builds, run with -Z macro-backtrace for more info)
